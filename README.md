# 🏙️ Pune Flat Price Analysis - Magic Bricks Web Scraping Project
This project focuses on analyzing flat prices in Pune by scraping data from Magic Bricks. The goal is to identify key factors influencing flat prices across different localities and uncover patterns in the real estate market.

# 🔍 Project Overview
With the growing demand for real estate in Pune, understanding how various factors influence flat prices can provide valuable insights. In this project, I collected real-time data directly from Magic Bricks using Python-based web scraping techniques and performed data analysis to uncover trends.

# 📌 Key Objectives:

- Analyze the impact of key factors such as:
- Flat Size (BHK)
  Furnishing Type (Semi-furnished / Unfurnished)
- Construction Stage (Ready to move / Under Construction)
- Number of Bathrooms and Bedrooms
- Location and Locality

# 📊 Data Analysis Highlights:
- Explore how flat size and furnishing type affect pricing
- Visualize the distribution of flat types (2BHK, 3BHK, etc.)
- Identify trends based on construction stage and locality
- Analyze pricing patterns in popular localities of Pune

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python (for web scraping using BeautifulSoup / Requests)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data cleaning and analysis)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for performing the tasks)

# 🖼️ Screenshots of Visualizations:
